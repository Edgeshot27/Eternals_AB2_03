            "title": "Noncoding RNAs serve as the deadliest regulators for cancer",
            "abstract": "  Cancer is one of the leading causes of human death. Many efforts have made to\nunderstand its mechanism and have further identified many proteins and DNA\nsequence variations as suspected targets for therapy. However, drugs targeting\nthese targets have low success rates, suggesting the basic mechanism still\nremains unclear. Here, we develop a computational software combining Cox\nproportional-hazards model and stability-selection to unearth an overlooked,\nyet the most important cancer drivers hidden in massive data from The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA), including 11,574 RNAseq samples and clinic data.\nGenerally, noncoding RNAs primarily regulate cancer deaths and work as the\ndeadliest cancer inducers and repressors, in contrast to proteins as\nconventionally thought. Especially, processed-pseudogenes serve as the primary\ncancer inducers, while lincRNA and antisense RNAs dominate the repressors.\nStrikingly, noncoding RNAs serves as the universal strongest regulators for all\ncancer types although personal clinic variables such as alcohol and smoking\nsignificantly alter cancer genome. Furthermore, noncoding RNAs also work as\ncentral hubs in cancer regulatory network and as biomarkers to discriminate\ncancer types. Therefore, noncoding RNAs overall serve as the deadliest cancer\nregulators, which refreshes the basic concept of cancer mechanism and builds a\nnovel basis for cancer research and therapy. Biological functions of\npseudogenes have rarely been recognized. Here we reveal them as the most\nimportant cancer drivers for all cancer types from big data, breaking a wall to\nexplore their biological potentials.\n",

            "abstract": "  Motivation: Uncovering the genomic causes of cancer, known as cancer driver\ngenes, is a fundamental task in biomedical research. Cancer driver genes drive\nthe development and progression of cancer, thus identifying cancer driver genes\nand their regulatory mechanism is crucial to the design of cancer treatment and\nintervention. Many computational methods, which take the advantages of computer\nscience and data science, have been developed to utilise multiple types of\ngenomic data to reveal cancer drivers and their regulatory mechanism behind\ncancer development and progression. Due to the complexity of the mechanistic\ninsight of cancer genes in driving cancer and the fast development of the\nfield, it is necessary to have a comprehensive review about the current\ncomputational methods for discovering different types of cancer drivers.\nResults: We survey computational methods for identifying cancer drivers from\ngenomic data. We categorise the methods into three groups, methods for single\ndriver identification, methods for driver module identification, and methods\nfor identifying personalised cancer drivers. We also conduct a case study to\ncompare the performance of the current methods. We further analyse the\nadvantages and limitations of the current methods, and discuss the challenges\nand future directions of the topic. In addition, we investigate the resources\nfor discovering and validating cancer drivers in order to provide a one-stop\nreference of the tools to facilitate cancer driver discovery. The ultimate goal\nof the paper is to help those interested in the topic to establish a solid\nbackground to carry out further research in the field.\n",

            "abstract": "  Cancer is known as a disease mainly caused by gene alterations. Discovery of\nmutated driver pathways or gene sets is becoming an important step to\nunderstand molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. However, systematically\ninvestigating commonalities and specificities of driver gene sets among\nmultiple cancer types is still a great challenge, but this investigation will\nundoubtedly benefit deciphering cancers and will be helpful for personalized\ntherapy and precision medicine in cancer treatment. In this study, we propose\ntwo optimization models to \\emph{de novo} discover common driver gene sets\namong multiple cancer types (ComMDP) and specific driver gene sets of one\ncertain or multiple cancer types to other cancers (SpeMDP), respectively. We\nfirst apply ComMDP and SpeMDP to simulated data to validate their efficiency.\nThen, we further apply these methods to 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) and obtain several biologically meaningful driver pathways. As\nexamples, we construct a common cancer pathway model for BRCA and OV, infer a\ncomplex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver\ngene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver\npathways of the liquid cancer lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (LAML)\nversus other solid cancer types. In these processes more candidate cancer genes\nare also found.\n",

            "abstract": "  The goal of this study is an exploratory analysis concerning main sensor\ntechnologies applied in cancer research to detect new directions in diagnosis\nand treatments. The study focused on types of cancer having a high incidence\nand mortality worldwide: breast, lung, colorectal and prostate. Data of the Web\nof Science (WOS) core collection database are used to retrieve articles related\nto sensor technologies and cancer research over 1991-2021 period. We utilized\nGephi software version 0.9.2 to visualize the co-word networks of the\ninteraction between sensor technologies and cancers under study. Results show\nmain clusters of interaction per typology of cancer. Biosensor is the only type\nof sensor that plays an essential role in all types of cancer: breast cancer,\nlung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. Electrochemical sensor is\napplied in all types of cancer under study except lung cancer. Electrochemical\nbiosensor is used in breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer research\nbut not colorectal cancer. Optical sensor can also be considered one of the\nsensor technologies that significantly is used in breast cancer, prostate\ncancer, and colorectal cancer. This study shows that this type of sensor is\napplied in more diversified approaches. Moreover, the oxygen sensor is mostly\nstudied in lung cancer and breast cancer due to the usage in breath analysis\nfor the treatment process. Finally, Cmos sensor is a technology used mainly in\nlung cancer and colorectal cancer. Results here suggest new directions for the\nevolution of science and technology of sensors in cancer research to support\ninnovation and research policy directed to new technological trajectories\nhaving a potential of accelerated growth and positive social impact for\ndiagnosis and treatments of cancer.\n",
